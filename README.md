Welcome to the Code repo. Information from the included spreadsheet is added to the NIAID Bioinformatics Portal (NBP) database and displayed. https://bioinformatics.niaid.nih.gov/code

To update the NBP database:

1. Download the code.xlsx file.

2. Edit the file, adding new training information. Among the fields in the spreadsheet are required fields. These are:

name
description
url
keywords
category

3. Information about which 'category' can be used is found in the 'Notes' column along with other information. If a required field is left empty, the data will not be added to the database.

4. Save the file as a .xslx AND a .csv. (It is the .csv file that is read by the update script. The .xslx file is for user-readability).

5. Commit them both to the repo.

6. Notify Yamil that a commit has been made: yamil.booirizarry @ nih.gov
